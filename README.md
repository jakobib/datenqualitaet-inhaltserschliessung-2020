This repository contains notes for an article about quality of data and services for subject indexing (APIs, formats, technical interoperability...) to be published in 2020.

## Metadata

* German or English?
* less than 35.000 characters (around 5.000 words)
* deadline around Summer 2020

## First notes

The article will summarize and evaluate data formats and services for subject indexing and content analysis on a technical level (interoperability). The article will neither deal with quality of subject indexing nor with quality of tools to process this data but with formats, specifications, and systems to process subject indexing information.

Quality of tools and algorithms will be covered in another article.

* data formats
    * as part of bibliographic data (e.g. which MARC fields contain subject indexing)
    * authority records data (e.g. SKOS)

* data exchange and reuse
    * where is subject indexing data created, stored, exchanged and reused?
    * interoperability between data formats
    * interoperability between data providers and users

* services (*this needs to be aligned with article about tools*)
    * to get authority data (dumps, APIs...):
    * to get indexing data (both for selected documents and for selected subjects, e.g. BEACON)
    * for (semi-)automatic indexing (how to track provenance)
